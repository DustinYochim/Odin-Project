# Introduction

## How The Course Works

### How it Works
The Odin Project is an open-source community  for full-stack web development.

The curriculum works by gathering content from around the internet to teach a specific topic. Lessons may contain knowledge checks, exercises, or projects.

### Tools
Main goal is that after completing the course you will be in a position where you can simply jump straight into the documentation for anything you are trying to learn.

## Introduction to Web Development

### Types of Web Developers
**Front-end developers** use HTML, CSS, JS and frameworks to display content.

**Back-end developers** use programming languages like Java, Python, Ruby, JavaScript to work with data.

**Full-stack developers** do both front and back end development.

## Motivation and Mindset
### Growth Mindset
Mindset is very important and it is crucial to foster a growth mindset where you believe you can get bettter at anything with effort and persistence.
### The Learning Process
When learning, the mind switches between focus and diffuse modes.

Focus mode occurs when consciously focusing on learning. Diffuse happens when you are not actively focused on learning.

PUT EFFORT INTO SOLVING A PROBLEM THEN TAKE A BREAK
### What to do when stuck
When stuck: Google -> Take a Break -> Ask for Help
### Managing Study Time
Put consistent time in rather than once a week.
Pomodoro to avoid procrastination.
During breaks: music, journal, doodle, mediate, walk
## Asking for Help
1. Understand the code to the best of your ability.
* examine line by line, take notes
* google unfamiliar topics
* use debugger
2. Clearly describe the problem.
3. Provide the code that illustrates the problem.
4. Make sure the code reproduces the problem.
5. Format code consistently.
6. Check for typos.
7. Explain what you did to troubleshoot.
8. Explain what you think the problem might be.
9. Proofread the question.
